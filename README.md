This is a simple imperative language for testing concepts.

First iterations will be used to test classical parallel programming concepts (Hoare's monitors and semaphores).

Currently it's a totally dynamic language, the compiler just parses the code and generates bytecode without any checks, so programs are super likely to crash.

Later, if I find time, I want to add static type checking etc.

I might also use it to test other concepts in the future, or maybe someone else will want to fork it to test their ideas ;)
